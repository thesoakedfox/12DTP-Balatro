addressing relevant implications.
Excellence- Develop a refined digital outcome to manage data
iterative improvement throughout the design, development and testing process
presenting the data effectively for the purpose and to meet end-user requirements.

writing code for a program that performs a specified task 
using advanced techniques in a suitable programming language
setting out the program code clearly and documenting the program with comments 
testing and debugging the program to ensure that it works on a sample of expected cases.
Merit
documenting the program with appropriate names and comments that describe code function and behaviour
following common conventions for the chosen programming language
testing and debugging the program effectively to ensure that it works on a sample of both expected cases and relevant boundary cases. 
Excellence
ensuring that the program is a well-structured, logical response to the specified task
making the program flexible and robust
comprehensively testing and debugging the program. 

Achieved
using appropriate project management tools and techniques to plan the development of a digital technologies outcome
decomposing the outcome into smaller components
trialing the components of the digital technologies outcome
testing that the digital technologies outcome functions as intended
explaining relevant implications.
Merit
effectively using project management and version control tools and techniques to manage the development of a digital technologies outcome 
trialing multiple components and/or techniques and selecting those which are most suitable
using information appropriately from testing and trialling to improve the functionality of the digital technologies outcome 
addressing relevant implications. 
Excellence
discussing how the information from planning, testing and trialling of components assisted in the development of a high-quality outcome.
